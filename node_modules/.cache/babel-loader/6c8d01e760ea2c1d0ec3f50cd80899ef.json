So we realize there is a gap, we need a channel to bridge that gap, to match a tourist and a guide with similar backgrounds. Many people find it difficult to find the best places to visit. Places that are not readily found by an internet search engine. And some of the biggest problems tourism faces is finding guides that; 1) speak a common language, 2) understand the individual culture and what the client wishes to see/hear, and 3) where to focus their attention thereby saving time and money. By bridging this cultural disconnect and matching enthusiastic guides with tourists, we enhance the traveling experience for both the visitor and the guide.
